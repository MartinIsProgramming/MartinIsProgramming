### Hi there 👋, my name is Martin.
#### A passionate frontend developer! 🧑‍💻
I love frontend development and spend my free time searching the web for new technologies and trends to keep myself updated.

I currently work as a frontend developer at Clockwork, a financial application that aims to build and connect companies with private investments.

👨‍🔧 Some of the technologies that I am using are:
- React --> CRA/Next.js 
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- React router 
- CSS -> Styled Components/SASS
- React Query
- Redux


⚡ Fun fact: I am a React activist! 😆
